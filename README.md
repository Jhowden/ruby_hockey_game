## Ruby Hockey Game
This is going to be a simple ruby hockey game that can be played in the terminal.
The endgoal for this is to have similar game mechanics to the old NES game
Tecmo Cup Soccer (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8570i_80Fc).

  I will be TDDing and BDDing for full coverage.

I will post further instructions once a working version is complete.
